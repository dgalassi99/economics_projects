This project is an **extension** of the research conducted by **Sejas-Portillo et al. (2025)**.

The **original paper** analyzed over 7 million UK property sale transactions and found **significant price discontinuities at EPC rating band thresholds**. Properties just above a threshold fetch notably higher prices than those just below, despite having almost identical energy efficiency. This finding suggests that market participants exhibit **heuristic thinking** and **partial inattention**, focusing more on the simplified rating bands (A-G) rather than the precise underlying SAP score (1-100). A key finding of the original paper relevant to the extension is that sellers are **more likely to make energy efficiency (EE) investments if their property is just below a threshold**.

Building on this, the **extension project's research question** asks: Do property owners strategically make **minimal energy efficiency investments just sufficient to cross EPC rating band thresholds** and capture potential price premiums?. The original authors provided descriptive evidence against this specific type of "strategic threshold gaming," but didn't formally model it.

Our project proposed to **define and estimate a model for these 'strategic upgrades'** – investments where the initial SAP score is just below a threshold and the final score is just above it. Using the same dataset subsample of properties that underwent pre-sale retrofitting, our **hypothesis** was that sellers whose initial EPC score is just below a rating band threshold are more likely to make an investment *that specifically just crosses that threshold*.

The **key findings of the extension** include:
*   Sellers whose initial SAP score is **closer to a threshold are more likely to make an investment specifically designed to just cross the next band**. This is captured by a negative coefficient (β < 0) on the running variable 'DistToThreshold'.
*   Visualizations suggest patterns where investments, particularly for properties starting in middle bands like E and D, result in final SAP scores clustering just above the threshold.
*   The effect of initial distance diminishes if the definition of a "strategic upgrade" (the "just above threshold" window) is widened significantly, especially when shifting the window towards properties starting further away from the next cutoff.
*   There was **no strong evidence of heterogeneity** in this strategic upgrade behavior based on property type or price.

In essence, the extension project confirms that being close to a threshold not only increases the likelihood of *any* investment (as found in the original paper) but also increases the likelihood of a *specific type of investment* that strategically aims to just clear the next rating band.
